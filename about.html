                    Engineer from Vancouver, BC who enjoys working on projects that solve interesting problems. 
                    I've worked on a wide variety of high-impact projects such as,
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>catharsis of a startup's legacy billing system, then rebuilding the billing system in Stripe, including an in-house invoice rendering system saving the company 1% in revenue yearly</li>
                    <li>building the next version of AWS Kinesis Data Firehose service's data ingestion system from scratch to support throughput of up to 100gb/s per instance (took the service component through the design, development, and testing phases to get it ready for production)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My strengths lie in my core ability to recognize what I need to learn, efficiently acquire that knowledge, and use that knowledge to solve impactful problems.
